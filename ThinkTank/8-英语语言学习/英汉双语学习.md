- [ ] **1. 清楚认知自己内在的力量**

一直想着“我解决不好这个”，或“我永远都熬不过这关”，会降低您实际的应对能力。 幸运的是，有头脑的人不会相信他们的所有想法。 当他们的想法变得不切实际的消极时，他们会提醒自己：他们比自己的大脑所暗示的更值得称赞。 他们会和自己进行鼓舞人心的谈话，会让自己想起他们过去所经历的艰难时期，以助于重新获得信心，应对自己遇到的任何困境。

> [!NOTE] They acknowledge their inner strength
> Thinking, "I can't deal with this," or, "I'll never get through this," diminishes your ability to cope. Fortunately, mentally strong people don't believe everything they think. When their thoughts become unrealistically negative, they remind themselves that they're stronger than their brains give them credit for. Giving themselves pep talks that remind them of past tough times they've endured helps them gain the confidence they need to handle whatever life throws in their way.

- [ ] **2. 好好照顾自己**

即使在最艰难的时期，心理强大的人也会将自我保养放在首位，因为他们知道，如果不照顾好自己的身心，应付苦难的过程将会变得更加困难。 他们健康饮食、合理运动并保持充足的休息，也因此，在应对挑战时可以保持最佳状态。

> [!info] They take care of themselves
>Mentally strong people make self-care a priority, even during the toughest times, because they know the struggle to cope with distress will be more difficult if they're not taking care of their mind and body. They eat healthily, exercise, and get plenty of rest so they can be at their best when tackling challenges.

- [ ] **3. 以掌控的部分**

精神上强大的人不会浪费时间，去想自己是否能重新来一遍，或者是担心灾难性的结果，又或者希望事情会有所不同。 他们清楚，这样的行为会耗尽他们解决问题所需的精神力量。也因此，他们选择将精力投入到可控的事情中，即使只是他们在应对时的心态。

> [!important] hey focus on what they can control
> Mentally strong people don't waste time rehashing conversations, worrying about catastrophic outcomes, or wishing things were different. They know such things will drain them of the mental strength they need to solve problems. So they put their resources into things they can control - even if that only thing is their attitude.

- [ ] **4. 分清轻重缓急**

精神强大的人知道，在艰难的时期需要认清工作重点，而不是纠结于没有花太多时间陪伴孩子、或拒绝了朋友的聚会邀请。 他们会将注意力转移到当下需要解决的问题上（例如还清债务、带家人去看医生，或投递简历寻求新工作等等）。

> [!question] They shuffle their priorities
> Rather than beat themselves up for not spending as much time with their kids, or for declining invitations with friends, mentally strong people know that priorities need to shift during tough times. They shift their attention to problems that need to be addressed (like paying off debt, driving a family member to medical appointments, or sending out resumes to land a new job).

- [ ] **5. 实际行动**

精神上强大的人可不会逃避问题、或举办吐苦水的聚会。 他们通过直面挑战，来实施真正有效率的行动。 如果问题无法解决（例如所爱之人患上的疾病），他们会采取健康的方式，来应对困境。

> [!abstract] They take action
> You won't catch a mentally strong person avoiding problems or hosting a pity party. They take productive action by tackling challenges head-on. If a problem can't be solved (as in the case of a loved one's illness), they take action to cope with distress in healthy ways.

- [ ] **6. 保持灵活思维**

僵化的思维——比如告诉自己事情必须以某种方式发展，或者你不应该有某种特定的情绪——会让事情变得更糟。内心强大的人知道他们需要保持灵活。他们乐于改变自己的认知、情感和行为模式，以适应新的挑战。


> [!question] They remain psychologically agile
> Rigid thinking - like telling yourself that a situation has to turn out a certain way, or that you shouldn't feel a specific emotion - can make things worse. Mentally strong people know they need to stay flexible. They're open to changing their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns to adapt to new challenges they face.

- [ ] **7. 寻求新机遇**

无论是失业危机还是健康恐慌，精神强大的人都知道，困难时期更需要努力应对。他们清楚，改变既可怕但又令人兴奋。 在努力奋斗，将挣扎变成积极的事情时，他们也愿意接受新的机会。

> [!tldr] They look for new opportunities
> Whether it's a job loss or health scare, mentally strong people know that difficult times may require them to pivot. They acknowledge that changing course can be scary, as well as exciting. They're open to new opportunities as they strive to turn struggles into something positive.

- [ ] **8. 学会感恩**

即使在最艰难的时期，心理强大的人也会表现出感激之情。 这并不是说他们就无视了痛苦、或将苦难减至了最小—他们当然承认自己的情感创伤。 但是他们也会使自己想起生活中所有美好的事物，以及那些支撑他们度过艰难时期的一切。


> [!quote] They practice gratitude
> Mentally strong people practice gratitude, even during the toughest times. That's not to say that they ignore pain or minimize hardship - they certainly acknowledge their emotional wounds. But they also remind themselves of all the good things in life and the resources they have to manage the tough times.

- [ ] **9. 吸取经验，从中学习**

虽然一遍又一遍地回顾痛苦的过去并没有帮助，但思考一下痛苦所教会我们的东西，可以帮助我们更好的恢复和成长。意志坚强的人知道，他们在最黑暗的时期里可以学到很多东西。 也因此，他们会花时间，认真思考自己从这些挑战中所收获的。


> [!example] They reflect on what they've learned
> While it's not helpful to replay painful memories over and over again, thinking about what your pain taught you can help you heal and grow. Mentally strong people know that they can learn a lot about themselves in their darkest hours. So they spend time reflecting on what is gained from challenges they endure.

- [ ] **10. 寻求帮助**

精神上很强的人明白，寻求帮助是很重要的，无论是请求家人帮忙照看孩子以便于自己解决问题，还是向治疗师寻求情感支持，这些都是强大，而非弱小的表现。 他们知道自己不必做所有事情。相反，他们愿意与他人、与那些愿意伸出援手帮忙度过难关的人们接触交流。

> [!warning] They seek support
> Mentally strong people know that asking for help - whether asking a family member to watch their children in order to work on an issue, or reaching out to a therapist for emotional support - is a sign of strength, not weakness. They know they don't have to do everything on their own. Instead, they're willing to reach out to people who can assist them in getting through tough times more easily.
